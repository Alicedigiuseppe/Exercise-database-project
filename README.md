Two databases were used for the project. One containing a pull of exercises chategorised depending of targeted muscles, location (gym/everywhere) and type of exercised (cardio/ strenght/ mix). The other database contains different styles of circuits and their characteristics. The two databases used were generated on excel and imported on MMSM.
